ðŸ§­ Microservices Architecture Roadmap with Go, gRPC, Docker, and Kubernetes
âœ… Phase 1: Foundation â€“ Microservices in Go
Goal: Build a solid and extensible structure

âœ… Define clean architecture for each service

âœ… Create core services: user_service, auth_service, api_gateway

âœ… Communication between services using gRPC

âœ… Use MongoDB per service with isolated models

âœ… Setup Gin for API Gateway (HTTP)

âœ… Implement JWT authentication (access token)

âœ… Handle login, register, and get user profile

âœ… Middleware support for JWT

âœ… Use Dependency Injection where needed

âœ… Phase 2: Event-Driven Communication with RabbitMQ
Goal: Decouple services using async communication

âœ… Install and connect RabbitMQ with Docker

âœ… Setup publisher in user_service

âœ… Setup consumer in email_service

âœ… Send UserRegistered event after registration

âœ… Use fanout exchange for pub/sub architecture

âœ… Phase 3: Security & Authentication
Goal: Token-based access control

âœ… Implement access token & refresh token

âœ… Store refresh token in Redis

âœ… /refresh-token endpoint in API Gateway

âœ… Delete old refresh tokens and generate new ones on refresh

âœ… Role-based access control (admin, user)

â¬œ Phase 4: Testing & Monitoring
Goal: Build trust with automated checks and observability

âœ… Unit tests with testify/mock

âœ… Structured logging (e.g. with zap)

âœ… Add health check endpoints (e.g. /healthz)

âœ… Prepare for Prometheus + Grafana integration (in K8s)

â¬œ Integration tests with Postman or Newman

â¬œ Load Testing with k6 or ghz

â¬œ CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions

âœ… Phase 5: Dockerization
Goal: Run the system in isolated containers

âœ… Create Dockerfile for each service

âœ… Setup docker-compose.yml with Mongo, Redis, RabbitMQ

âœ… Use shared .env files for environment configs

âœ… Verify end-to-end functionality with containers

â¬œ Phase 6: Kubernetes (K8s)
Goal: Deploy production-grade system

â¬œ Learn core concepts: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets

â¬œ Create K8s manifests for each service

â¬œ Optional: Build Helm charts for reuse

â¬œ Configure Ingress with NGINX

â¬œ Enable auto-scaling and liveness/readiness probes

â¬œ Test rolling updates and service discovery

â¬œ Phase 7: Cloud Deployment
Goal: Deploy to cloud with full CI/CD

â¬œ Choose cloud provider (EKS/GKE/AKS)

â¬œ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

â¬œ Store secrets securely

â¬œ Enable monitoring, scaling, and recovery

â¬œ Register custom domain and SSL (HTTPS)
